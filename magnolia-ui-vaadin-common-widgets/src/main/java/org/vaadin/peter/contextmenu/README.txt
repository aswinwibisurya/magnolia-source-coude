This package is a fork of Vaadin's ContextMenu addon from Peter Lehto.
The main purpose for this was to support the Magnolia icon-font for menu items.
see #setIcon(url) in org.vaadin.peter.contextmenu.client.ContextMenuItemWidget

Note: We should have a proper dependency to this addon, and eventually use a client-side patch for enabling the icon-font in menu items.
